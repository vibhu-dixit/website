            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Vibhu, a passionate engineer pursuing an MS in Computer Science at ASU. 
                I specialize in AI, machine learning, and recommendation systems. With a robust background 
                in full-stack development and generative AI, I create innovative solutions to complex challenges. I started my coding journey in grade 9 with HTML. My journey took me down the road to introduction to C++, which I started learning about in grade 11. I usually do my DSA practice in C++, which helps me keep in touch with the language and practice the concepts. In my undergraduate, I coded in C and Python, building bridges between similar languages. I incline ML and data science, with front-end development as my hobby.<br> You can get my resume by clicking <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fdm0clWGqJ6wix-C8tRD4666zqUiABcf?usp=sharing">here.</a>
